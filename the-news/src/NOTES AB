Paul's example plan for an app (on paper, I have done it on screen)

view 1: "/", maybe "/topics/:topic"?

header
links to topics
log in information
sortby options
list of all the articles, with each one being clickable

axios reqs:
api/articles
api/topics

view 2: "/articles/:article_id"
header
links to topics
log in information
sortby options
individual articles
comments

axios reqs:
api/articles/:article_id
api/topics
api/articles/:article_id/comments

APP STRUCTURE

app
 - header
   - loggedInUser
 - nav
   - topics
Router
 - articleslist
   - articlecard
     - information
     - voter
/Router

app 
 - header
   - loggedInUser
- nav
  - topics
Router
- singlearticle
  - comments
/Router

......
Note from question - don't use dropdowns for the topics as it makes the routing tricky.
find a balance between making it easy for the user but also shows that i have put in some work.

.......
in articlelist.js, make sure that i destructure this.state where possible

eg 

class article list extends component
state = {
  articles: []
}
render
const { articles } = this.state
return <section>
{articles.map(article => (
<p>{article.title}</p>
))}
</section>

extract the articlecard from articleslist and make it a new component

..............
if its in the url, eg /cooking, it is in props, so we can use this as a query
