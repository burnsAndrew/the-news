Q&A and pagination

maybe add extra user stuff in the state on app, eg username, user and avatar_url

pagination notes

need prev and next page buttons at the bottom of the articles list
these buttons will make a new api request
we will need to keep track of the page in state - so state = {page: 1}
when click next, we update the page number and componentdidupdate (if prev state page is not equal to this page)

we need a total count - it will stop errors (serving up an empty array) and also allow us to disable the button

in app, it's going to be articlelist
